# InfiniTime (my fork)
This is my fork of the InfiniTime firmware which I run on my PineTime watch. I have made it so I can make changes which may not make sense to put in the upstream version. The code here is likely to be messy since I am not going to try to make it neat since this is only intended for my own watch.

## Changes
Here is a list of the changes I have made from the upstream version:
- The alarm app shows you the time until the alarm as soon as you enable the alarm (so you don't have to press the small 'info' button)
- The Infineat watchface shows the battery percentage in the corner and the pinecone battery animation is disabled
